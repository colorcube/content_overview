# TYPO3 Extension: Web>Info, Content Overview

This is a TYPO3 extension.

## What does it do?

This extension provides a backend module which gives an overview of the the content elements in a page tree.

You can find the module under *Web > Info > Content Overview*. There are some filters available and the possibility to
click on the elements for editing and more information.

### Status ###

The module works as expected but I wouldn't call it 'finished'. Do you have ideas how to improve it?

The code is a bit ugly because TYPO3 backend code is almost always ugly. But I don't care (much).
