Development
============

This module was started because often one searches for a specific plugin on the website. Like "where's powermail used, I
can't find it?". Developers might use SQL to find plugins which is time consuming.

The module could be improved in many ways. The code is more or less glued together with fragments from other modules.
But more important is the usability. Does the module really help to find content in the page structure. I think there are
many possiblities for improvements. Even throwing this thing away and build a really good module is an option.

That means the extension is not finished yet. Any collaboration is welcome.
